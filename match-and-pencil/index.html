<p>Pencil is a female object. Behind the camera Aunt Match were already live. Ive always found them pretty great characters but at the same time I can kinda understand why people dislike them since theyve done some bad things in the past I think Match is better than Pencil in that regard since she actually apologized so I kinda prefer her to Pencil. This implies Match lacks the self-awareness to see the consequences. The pencil is neither too hard nor too oily and soft which makes it very easy to use. Yeah I know she was so surprised.

If left discharged for long enough it may not be able to be charged at all. Ensure Bluetooth is turned on. For the Apple Pencil 2nd Gen ensure to place it correctly on the magnetic connector of your iPad. Your Apple Pencil has now been disconnected from your iPad.

<p>I am starting to have this problem. Its surprising to see that the issue was reported 3 years ago and since then nothing has been done. Thank you for using Apple Support Communities. When plugging in the pencil it shows the battery widget and Bluetooth icon top right corner. Follow the relevant section below.

<p>Apple Pencil 1st Generation. Clearly shows that apple only wants people to spend money and doesnt really value their customers feedback. I have to plug the pencil into the iPad and then it starts working again. The pencil not pairing and only showing 3 battery. Unsolved After not using my apple pencil for 2 years I recently found it and wanted to start using it after plugging it in to charge I found that the battery went up super quickly after unplugging the apple pencil the battery immediately dropped to 3 and disconnected. The Pencil just stops working but its still recognized by the iPad pro for charging. Apple Pencil Not Working Here S Our Troubleshooting Guide Appletoolbox.</p>

<p>A lot of people whore new to using an Apple Pencil with their iPads dont really know that it runs on battery. Its surprising to see that the issue was reported 3 years ago and since then nothing has been done. I have to restart the iPad to get the pencil back. One of the most common reasons why your Apple Pencil gets disconnected during usage is simply because it ran out of battery. Clearly shows that apple only wants people to spend money and doesnt really value their customers feedback. It will connect momentarily then disconnect.

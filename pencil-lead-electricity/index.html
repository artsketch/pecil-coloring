<p>In fact the lead inside the pencil consists of properties of an electrical resistor and thus it acts as a resistor. So you ask your self. Graphite will conduct electric current but not as near as copper.</p>
<h3 id="diamond-does-not-conduct-electricity-so-how-does-graphite-conduct-electricity">Diamond does not conduct electricity so how does graphite conduct electricity.</h3><p>As compared to other types of resistors this resistor also offers resistance to the flow of electricity through it. Power Voltage x Current or P V x I. Diamond does not conduct electricity so how does graphite conduct electricity. Pencil lead strain gauge The electrical conductivity of pencil lead depends on the number and quality of contacts between graphite particles in the lead. There can be negative effects in using it also because lead is poisonous.</p>

<p>Therefore pencil lead is a conductor of electricity but has a high resistance. Id like to remind you all about being sure to use a pure graphite pencil and to make the lines exceptionally thick. Yes the pencil that we use in our day-to-day activities can be used as a resistor in electrical networks. Pencil lead is largely made of graphite a form of carbon hence pencil lead will conduct electricity. This discussion on Is pencil lead good condutor of electricity.

<p>How can that conduct electricity. Clay unlike graphite is an insulator. This discussion on Is pencil lead good condutor of electricity. The lead in pencil is contrary to its name predominately made up of a combination of graphite and clay with wax and other additives in small quantities. But its not up there with copper and silver. Its most common use that involves electricity is in resistors which is why its ability to conduct electricity drops greatly the longer the line is.

<p>Now let me give experienced of mine. That being said unless the voltage exceeds the BIL basic insulation level of the wood encasing the graphite or the wood is cracked or wet chances are you will not be aware of the current in the pencil. Graphite is simply the dark solid that we thought of as lead in pencil although there is no lead in it. If we combine these two equations we get the below equation. The pencil lead should light up.

<p>Well the reason for graphites ability. Graphite is simply the dark solid that we thought of as lead in pencil although there is no lead in it. As compared to other types of resistors this resistor also offers resistance to the flow of electricity through it. For example glass and rubber resist electricity completely whereas graphite cores in.

<p>The pencil lead is made up of compressed graphite and like a previous poster has noted graphite is an excellent conductor of electricity. Theyre a mix of graphite and clay which is a really poor conductor. Graphite is simply the dark solid that we thought of as lead in pencil although there is no lead in it.

<p>The most abundant graphene layer is located on the 2B pencil leads. How can that conduct electricity. Pencil lead strain gauge The electrical conductivity of pencil lead depends on the number and quality of contacts between graphite particles in the lead. That is it does not conduct electricity well due to the covalent bonds holding valence electrons tightly in place. Well the reason for graphites ability.

<p>When was lead used in pencils. The first pencil was just a chunk of graphite used by carpenters and artisans to make markings without denting their materials. Lead is a potent systemic poison that serves no known useful function once absorbed by your body.</p>
<h3 id="were-not-in-the-habit-of-crushing-dreams-but-we-have-to-break-it-to-you">Were not in the habit of crushing dreams but we have to break it to you.</h3><p>Of course sticks of pure graphite are fairly brittle so people started embedding them in various things such as hollowed out pieces of wood and also simply wrapped tightly in sheep skin. They are then placed in a kiln to harden then dipped in oil or wax which seeps into the tiny holes to make it smoother for writing. Most pencils are made of plastic and have a hollow barrel writing tip eraser and a built-in lead controlling method. Although todays machines are more sophisticated this is basically the way pencils are still made. Color pencil leads also used by artists and popular with children and students are made through a similar process of creating a blend of pigment china clay and wax that is extruded into a lead.</p>

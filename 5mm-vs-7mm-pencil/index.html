<p>A bit late here but if anyone knows of somewhere that I can find different hardness leads in a sort of sampler pack Id love to try it. Many pencils are only available in one size so if you know you want 09mm lead its no good looking at pencils only available in 05mm. Ive personally had nothing but good experiences with the 5mm but the 7mm is excellent as well so if youre on the fence I would go with the wider tip size. They are available in sizes from 03 mm to 09 mm and a variety of hardness grades 4H to 4B in 05 mm size so you can enjoy them no matter your pencil and lead grade preferences. The ratings are like this. Both this and the 32 mm size are highly versatile as they are easier to sharpen and use for fine details than broader leads but can also be used at an angle for shading and loose drawing styles.

For my Sakurai Sumo Grip it feels very comfortable so I use 09mm thats the only unique pencil where I prefer 09mm to all others. The size of the lead 03mm 05mm 07mm 09mm 13mm etc is just the width of the lead. I also press hard and tend to break 5mm lead but the Pentel Kerry mechanical pencil and others with the same tip such as drafting mechanical pencils really cut this down. Taking the obvious out of the way first since the 05mm is thinner all else being equal it will break more easily than the 07mm and the thinner line will be marginally harder to read under some conditions. Like 03mm leads these are more commonly found in HB and harder. Pin On Olovke.</p>

<p>Lead diameters for mechanical pencils generally range from 03mm to 09mm with the most common thicknesses being 05mm and 07mm. Aug 16 2013 Messages. A bit late here but if anyone knows of somewhere that I can find different hardness leads in a sort of sampler pack Id love to try it. However several companies have recently changed their standard size from 05mm to 07mm eg. Softer harder B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 HB H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 darker lighter Most lead refill packs you buy from. Im currently experimenting with 05mm was 07mm for my entire life and I love it curious about whether 03mm is for me and whether Id like 05mm in a different hardness than HB.

Lead diameters for mechanical pencils generally range from 03mm to 09mm with the most common thicknesses being 05mm and 07mm.

<p>2 mm - 32 mm. 05mm tips are on the finer side of the spectrum. Like 03mm leads these are more commonly found in HB and harder. I also press hard and tend to break 5mm lead but the Pentel Kerry mechanical pencil and others with the same tip such as drafting mechanical pencils really cut this down. There is something of a debate with respect to 5mm vs 7mm in the Jetstream line. Both this and the 32 mm size are highly versatile as they are easier to sharpen and use for fine details than broader leads but can also be used at an angle for shading and loose drawing styles.

<p>Ive personally had nothing but good experiences with the 5mm but the 7mm is excellent as well so if youre on the fence I would go with the wider tip size. The fine line is suitable for both writing and technical drawing. Many of the more technical style of pencil are available in several different widths most often 05mm 07mm and 09mm while some add 03mm or 2mm to the range. I tend to press down too hard when writing and the 5mm breaks more often than the 7mm so 7mm is my typical load. If you double the depth at this point the 5mm and the lycra gain a lead over the thicker. Fountain pen nibs are graded as extra fine fine medium broad double broad and stubsitalics.

<p>It has variably been known as Coryphantha robertii. The Christmas Cactus is named so because it blooms near the Christmas season when the days are much shorter. They are also known as spines or prickles and their main function is to deter the animals from eating plants. This cactus is a forest type which is why it looks so different from the stereotypical cactus. The white latex is the only toxic part and these plants have no thorns.

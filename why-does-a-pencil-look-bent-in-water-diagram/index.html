<p>This change in speed causes the light to bend or refract meaning that the part of the pencil that is in the water will appear shifted. Furthermore the portion of the pencil that is submerged in water appears to be wider than the portion of the pencil that is not submerged.

<p>This is because the optically denser medium will cause more refraction of light rays. A ray of light OC coming from the lower end O passes from water into air at C and gets refracted away from the normal in. The refraction causes an apparent shift in the position of the part of the pencil within the water. Simply putlight cant travel as fast in water as it does in the air. Refraction makes a pencil look bent where it enters water This effect is known as refraction controlled by a property of the materials known as their refractive index. Basically the light refraction gives the pencil a slight magnifying effect which makes the angle appear bigger than it actually is causing the pencil to look crooked.

The virtual image is made when the refracted light is extended or projected from the eye to the object ruler. Refraction makes a pencil look bent where it enters water This effect is known as refraction controlled by a property of the materials known as their refractive index.

<p>Why do pencils look bent in water class 10. Simply putlight cant travel as fast in water as it does in the air. A stick or a pencil half immersed in water at an angle appears bent due to refraction of light at the air-water surface. A pencil in water looks bent because of refraction. A The stick appears to be bent and raised up in place of BA as BA due to refraction of light on passing from denser medium water to rarer medium air. The apparent bending of the pencil is due to the refraction of light when it passes from water to air.

<p>Basically the light refraction gives the pencil a slight magnifying effect which makes the angle appear bigger than it actually is causing the pencil to look crooked. The reason why this is the case is because light travels slower in water than it does air. The apparent bending of the pencil is due to the refraction of light when it passes from water to air. Give reasons for your answer. When light hits the object light then travels through the water and bends when it hits the air. Application of Refraction Refraction is defined as the bending of a beam of light when it travels from medium to another medium.
